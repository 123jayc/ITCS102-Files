# Create a fun program that acts like a parrot â€” it repeats anything 
# the user says, using a for loop to "squawk" it back multiple times!
# Ask the user to enter a phrase (e.g., "I love Python!").
# Ask how many times they want the parrot to repeat it.
# Use a for loop to print the phrase that many times.
# Make each line sound like a parrot: " Squawk! {phrase}"   
#Listen to your parrot:
#ðŸ¦œ Squawk! I am hungry!
